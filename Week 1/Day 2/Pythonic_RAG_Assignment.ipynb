Data engineers are \\nessential in creating and maintaining the infrastructure that enab les organizations to leverage \\ndata for decision -making and innovation.  \\n \\nLesson 3: Key Concepts and Terminologies  \\nObjective:  \\nGet familiar with essential data engineering concepts and terminology.  \\n1. Critical Data Engineering Concepts:  \\nData engineering involves several key concepts that form the foundation of effective data \\nmanagement and processing. Understanding these concepts is crucial for anyone looking to \\nwork in this field.  • Data Ingestion:  \\no Definition:  The process of importing data from various sources into a database \\nor data warehouse.  \\no Example:  Collecting data from transactional systems, sensors, social media, and \\nexternal APIs.  \\no Analogy:  Imagine data ingestion like filling a water tank. The water comes from \\nmultiple streams (data sources), and the tank (database) needs to store it all.  \\n• Data Transformation:  \\no Definition:  The process of converting data from its raw format into a more \\nsuitable format for analysis.  \\no Example:  Cleaning data, removing duplicates, standardizing formats, and \\nenriching data with additional information.  \\no Analogy:  Think of data transformation like making a smoothie. You take raw \\ningredients (data), blend them together to create a consistent mixture, and add \\nany necessary enhancements (enrichments).  \\n• Data Storage:  \\no Definition:  Storing data in a structured and organized manner to facilitate easy \\naccess and analysis.  \\no Example:  Using relational databases, NoSQL databases, data warehouses, and \\ndata lakes.  \\no Analogy:  Data storage is like organizing a library. Books (data) are categorized \\nand shelved in a way that makes them easy to find and use.  \\n• Data Governance:  \\no Definition:  Establishing policies and procedures to ensure data quality, security, \\nand compliance.  \\no Example:  Implementing access controls, data encryption, and data quality \\nchecks.  \\no Analogy:  Data governance is like managing a bank. It involves setting rules and \\nprotocols to ensure that money (data) is handled securely, accurately, and \\naccording to regulations.  \\n• Data Security:  \\no Definition:  Protecting data from unauthorized access, breaches, and other \\nsecurity threats.  \\no Example:  Using encryption, firewalls, and secure access controls.  \\no Analogy:  Data security is like installing a security system in your house. It \\nensures that valuable possessions (data) are protected from theft or damage.  \\n2. Explanation of Key Terminologies:  \\nUnderstanding the terminology used in data engineering is essential for effective communication \\nand collaboration within the field.  \\n• ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):  \\no Definition:  A process that involves extracting data from source systems, \\ntransforming it into a usable format, and loading it into a destination system.  \\no Example:  Extracting sales data from a transactional system, cleaning and \\nstandardizing it, and loading it into a data warehouse for analysis.  \\no Analogy:  ETL is like making a smoothie. You extract ingredients (data) from \\ndifferent places, blend them together (transform), and pour the smoothie into a \\nglass (load).  \\n• ELT:  o Definition:  A process that involves extracting data from source systems, \\ntransforming it into a usable format, and loading it into a destination system.  \\no Example:  Extracting sales data from a transactional system, cleaning and \\nstandardizing it, and loading it into a data warehouse for analysis.  \\no Analogy:  ETL is like baking a cake. You collect the ingredients (extract), mix and \\nbake them according to the recipe (transform), and then place the finished cake \\non a serving plate (load).  \\n• Data Warehouse:  \\no Definition:  A centralized repository where data is stored for analysis and \\nreporting.  \\no Example:  Using Amazon Redshift to store and analyze large volumes of \\nstructured data.  \\no Analogy:  A data warehouse is like a library. It stores vast amounts of information \\n(data) organized in a way that makes it easy to find and use.  \\n• Data Lake:  \\no Definition:  A storage system that holds a large amount of raw data in its native \\nformat until it is needed.  \\no Example:  Using Amazon S3 to store raw log files, images, and other \\nunstructured data.  \\no Analogy:  A data lake is like a large storage room. It keeps everything as it is \\nuntil someone comes in to organize and use the items.  \\n• Real -Time Processing:  \\no Definition:  Processing data as it arrives, enabling immediate analysis and \\naction.  \\no Example:  Using Apache Kafka to process streaming data from IoT devices in \\nreal-time.  \\no Analogy:  Real-time processing is like live broadcasting. Data is captured and \\nprocessed instantly, allowing for immediate viewing and response.  \\n• Batch Processing:  \\no Definition:  A method of processing data where transactions are collected over a \\nperiod of time and processed together in a single batch.  \\no Example:  Using Apache Hadoop to process large volumes of log files overnight.  \\no Analogy:  Batch processing is like doing laundry. You gather dirty clothes over \\ntime (collect transactions), and then wash them all at once in a single load \\n(process the batch).  \\n• Full Load:  with a full load, the entire dataset is dumped, or loaded, and is then \\ncompletely replaced (i.e. deleted and replaced) with the new, updated dataset. \\nNo additional information, such as timestamps, is required. For example, take a \\nstore that uploads all of its sales through the ETL process in data warehouse at \\nthe end of each day. Let’s say 5 sales were made on a Monday, so that on \\nMonday night a table of 5 records would be uploaded. Then, on Tuesday, \\nanother 3 s ales were made which need to be added. So on Tuesday night, assuming a full load, Monday’s 5 records as well as Tuesday’s 3 records are \\nuploaded – an inefficient system, although relatively easy to set up and maintain. \\nWhile this example is overly simplified, the principle is the same.  \\n \\n• Incremental load:  only the difference between the target and source data is \\nloaded through the ETL process in data warehouse. There are 2 types of \\nincremental loads, depending on the volume of data you’re loading: streaming \\nincremental load and batch incremental load.  Following the previous example, \\nthe store that made 3 sales on Tuesday will load only the additional 3 records to \\nthe sales table, instead of reloading all records. This has the advantage of saving \\ntime and resources but increases complexity.  Incremental loading is of course \\nmuch faster than a full load. The main drawback to this type of loading is \\nmaintainability. Unlike a full load, with an incremental load you can’t re -run the \\nentire load if there’s an error. In addition to this, files need to be loaded in order, \\nso errors will compound the issue as other data queues up.  \\nSummary:  \\nIn this lesson, we explored essential data engineering concepts and terminologies, including \\ndata ingestion, transformation, storage, governance, and security. We also explained key terms \\nsuch as ETL, data pipelines, data warehouses, data lakes, and real -time processing. \\nUnderstanding these concepts and terminologies is crucial for anyone working in the field of \\ndata engineering, as they form the foundation of effective data management and processing.  \\n TOPIC 2  \\nToday, we\\'ll explore how data flows through a modern data system, examining the key \\ncomponents and their interactions. We\\'ll also touch on the undercurrents that influence every \\nstage of this process.  \\nI. The Core Pipeline  \\nLet\\'s start with the heart of our lifecycle: the core pipeline.  \\n1. Generation: Our journey begins with data generation. This is where data is born, \\noriginating from various sources such as user interactions, IoT devices, or business \\ntransactions. Think of this as the wellspring of our data river.  \\n2. Ingestion: As our data flows from its source, it enters the ingestion phase. Here, we \\ncollect and import the raw data into our system. It\\'s like a giant funnel, gathering \\ninformation from multiple sources and preparing it for the next stage.  \\n3. Storage: Once ingested, our data needs a home. The storage layer acts as a vast reservoir, \\nholding both raw and processed data. This could be a data lake, a data warehouse, or a \\ncombination of storage solutions.  \\n4. Transformation: Now comes the alchemical stage of our journey. In the transformation \\nphase, raw data is refined and restructured. We clean it, enrich it, and shape it into a form \\nthat\\'s useful for analysis. It\\'s like turning ore into gold.  \\n5. Serving: With our data transformed, it\\'s time to serve it up. The serving layer makes our \\nprocessed data available for consumption. It\\'s the distribution center, packaging our data \\nproducts for various uses.  \\nII. Advanced Use Cases  \\nFrom our serving layer, data flows into three key advanced use cases:  \\n1. Analytics: Here, our data powers business intelligence, generating insights that drive \\ndecision -making. It\\'s where we answer questions and uncover trends.  \\n2. Machine Learning: Our refined data becomes the fuel for predictive models. In this stage, \\nwe\\'re not just understanding the past, but predicting the future.  \\n3. Reverse ETL: This is a fascinating newer concept. Reverse ETL takes our insights and \\npredictions and feeds them back into operational systems. It\\'s closing the loop, allowing \\nour data -driven insights to directly influence business processes.  \\nIII. The Undercurrents  \\nFlowing beneath our visible pipeline are six critical undercurrents. These influence every stage \\nof our lifecycle:  \\n1. Security: Ensuring our data remains protected and compliant at all times.  \\n2. Data Management: Overseeing the quality, metadata, and governance of our data.  3. DataOps: Applying DevOps principles to create efficient, automated data workflows.  \\n4. Data Architecture: Designing the overall structure of our data systems.  \\n5. Orchestration: Coordinating and scheduling our various data processes.  \\n6. Software Engineering: Applying robust development practices to our data engineering \\ntasks.  \\nConclusion: The Data Engineering Lifecycle is a complex, interconnected system. Each \\ncomponent builds upon the last, creating a flowing river of data that powers our modern, data -\\ndriven world. The undercurrents ensure this river flows smoothly, securely, a nd efficiently.  \\nAs we progress through this course, we\\'ll dive deeper into each of these components, exploring \\nadvanced concepts and practical applications. Remember, in the world of data engineering, \\neverything is connected. Understanding these connections is key to mast ering the field.  \\nTOPIC 3  \\nLesson 1: What is Data Quality and Why is it Important?  \\nObjective:  \\nUnderstand the concept of data quality and its significance in data engineering.  \\n1. Definition of Data Quality:  \\nData quality refers to the condition of a dataset that determines its fitness to serve its purpose in \\na given context. High -quality data is accurate, complete, reliable, and relevant.  \\nDimensions of Data Quality:  \\n• Accuracy:  Data accurately reflects the real -world entities or values it represents. \\nThis means there are no errors, distortions, or misrepresentations in the data, \\nensuring that it can be reliably used for decision -making and analysis.  \\n• Completeness:  All necessary data is available without any missing elements. \\nThis ensures that the dataset contains all required information, which is crucial \\nfor comprehensive analysis and reporting. Incomplete data can lead to incorrect \\nconclusions and decisions.  \\n• Consistency:  Data remains uniform across different systems and formats, \\nmaintaining harmony in how information is presented and interpreted. Consistent \\ndata ensures that information is reliable and can be cross -referenced accurately, \\nreducing the risk of discrepancies.  • Timeliness:  Data is up -to-date and available when needed. Timely data means \\nthat the information reflects the most current state of affairs, which is essential for \\nmaking relevant and accurate decisions. Outdated data can lead to missed \\nopportunities and incorrect ass essments.  \\n• Validity:  Data conforms to the defined formats, rules, and standards. Valid data \\nensures that the information is in the correct format and follows established \\nguidelines, making it usable and reliable. Invalid data can lead to errors in \\nprocessing and interpretation . \\n• Uniqueness:  Data is free from duplicates, ensuring that each piece of information \\nis distinct. Unique data prevents redundancy and ensures that every entry is only \\nrecorded once. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity and efficiency of the \\ndatabase, as duplicat es can lead to confusion and inefficiency.  \\n2. The Impact of Poor Data Quality:  \\nOn Business Decisions:  \\nPoor data quality can lead to incorrect business decisions, resulting in financial losses, missed \\nopportunities, and reduced competitiveness.  \\nOn Operations:  \\nOperational inefficiencies can arise from using poor -quality data, leading to increased costs, \\ncustomer dissatisfaction, and compliance issues.  \\nExamples of Data Quality Issues and Their Consequences:  \\n• Inaccurate Customer Data:  Leads to incorrect targeting in marketing campaigns, \\nresulting in wasted resources and reduced ROI.  \\n• Incomplete Financial Data:  Causes errors in financial reporting and decision -making, \\npotentially leading to regulatory penalties.  \\n• Inconsistent Product Data:  Results in supply chain inefficiencies and poor inventory \\nmanagement.  \\n3. Importance of Data Quality in Data Engineering:  \\nEnsuring Reliable Analytics:  \\nHigh-quality data is essential for accurate analytics, machine learning models, and business \\nintelligence. Reliable data leads to trustworthy insights and better decision -making.  Maintaining Data Integrity:  \\nEnsuring data quality helps maintain the integrity of data systems, preventing errors and \\ninconsistencies that can compromise data reliability.  \\nEnhancing Customer Trust:  \\nProviding high -quality data builds customer trust, as accurate and reliable information is critical \\nfor customer satisfaction and loyalty.  \\nSummary:  \\nIn this lesson, we explored the concept of data quality, its dimensions, and its significance in \\ndata engineering.

Definition of a Data Warehouse:  \\nA data warehouse is a centralized repository designed to store large volumes of structured data \\nfrom multiple sources. It\\'s like a giant organized archive specifically built for analyzing \\ninformation. This information helps with business intelligence (BI) activities, such as uncovering \\ntrends, generating reports, and making data -driven decisions . Key Characteristics:  \\n• Optimized for Querying and Analysis:  Think of it like a giant filing cabinet \\nspecifically designed for easy searching and analysis.  \\n• Integrated:  Data from various sources is brought together and organized \\nconsistently.  \\n• Subject-Oriented:  Focused on specific business topics, like sales or customer \\ndata.  \\n• Non-Volatile:  Data is not deleted or overwritten, allowing you to track changes over \\ntime.  \\n• Time-Variant: Includes historical data alongside current information for trend \\nanalysis.  \\n• Designed for Decision Support:  Provides insights to inform better business \\nchoices.  \\n3. Benefits of Using Data Warehouses:  \\nImproved Data Quality:  \\nData warehouses consolidate data from various sources, apply data cleansing processes, and \\nensure data consistency and accuracy.  \\nEnhanced Performance:  \\nData warehouses are optimized for read -heavy operations, enabling fast query performance \\nand reducing the load on transactional systems.  \\nHistorical Insights:  \\nStoring historical data allows organizations to analyze trends, perform time -series analysis, and \\ngenerate forecasts.  \\nScalability:  \\nData warehouses are designed to handle large volumes of data, making them suitable for \\ngrowing data needs.  \\nAdvanced Analytics:  \\nSupports complex queries, data mining, machine learning, and other advanced analytics \\ntechniques.  \\nSummary:  \\nIn this lesson, we introduced the concept of data warehousing, explaining its definition, role in \\ndata engineering, and benefits. Data warehouses are essential for integrating data from multiple sources, ensuring data quality, enhancing performance, providing historical insights, and \\nsupporting advanced analytics.  \\n \\nLesson 2: Data Warehousing Architectures  \\nObjective:  \\nLearn about different data warehousing architectures.  \\n \\nSimilarities and Key Differences: Databases vs. Data Warehouses  \\nWhile both store data, databases and data warehouses have distinct purposes. Databases manage \\ndata for various day -to-day transactions, like an ATM system. Data warehouses, on the other \\nhand, handle large -scale data analysis. They store historical information for com plex analytical \\nqueries, unlike databases that focus on real -time data.  \\nData Warehouse Structure: Three Layers Working Together  \\nA data warehouse typically has a three -tier architecture:  \\n• Bottom Tier:  The foundation, usually a relational database system. Data is cleansed, \\ntransformed, and loaded here using back -end tools.  \\n• Middle Tier:  \\u202f The Middle Tier  features an OLAP server that facilitates rapid \\nquery processing. Within this tier, three distinct types of OLAP models are \\nutilized - ROLAP, MOLAP, and HOLAP. The type of database system that is being \\nused will determine which OLAP model is best.  \\n• Top Tier:  The user interface, where you access information. It provides tools for \\nquerying, analyzing, reporting, and data mining.  \\nHow Data Warehouses Function: Integration and Analysis  \\nData warehouses bring together information from various sources into a single, unified database. \\nImagine combining customer data from sales systems, mailing lists, websites, and feedback \\nforms. It can even hold confidential employee data. Businesses levera ge this combined data to \\ngain customer insights.  \\nData mining is a powerful feature of data warehouses. It involves sifting through vast amounts of \\ndata to discover hidden patterns and trends. Businesses can then use these insights to develop \\nstrategies that boost sales and profits.  \\nTypes of Data Warehouses: Different Solutions for Different Needs  \\nThere are three main types of data warehouses:  • Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW):  This centralized data hub provides crucial \\ninformation for decision -making across the entire organization. It offers a unified view of \\ndata, allowing for cross -departmental analysis and complex queries.  \\n• Operational Data Store (ODS):  This warehouse refreshes data in real -time, making it \\nsuitable for operational tasks like managing employee records. It\\'s used when data \\nwarehouses can\\'t meet a company\\'s reporting needs.  \\n• Data Mart:  This is a focused subset of a data warehouse, catering to a specific \\ndepartment, region, or business unit. Each department might have its own data mart to \\nstore relevant data. Information from data marts is periodically uploaded to the ODS, \\nwhich then fee ds it into the EDW for long -term storage and analysis.  \\nSUMMARY:  \\nData warehouses, unlike databases, analyze historical data for trends. Their layered \\nstructure cleanses, stores, and analyzes data. Businesses can combine information from \\nvarious sources and use data mining to find hidden patterns. There are different \\narchitectures for enterprise -wide insights, real -time tasks, and specific depart ments. \\nUnderstanding these helps businesses choose the right tool to unlock data\\'s potential.  \\n \\nLesson 3: Data Warehouse Modeling  \\nObjective: By the end of this lesson, you will understand the fundamental concepts of data \\nwarehouse modeling, including dimensions, facts, and common schema types. You\\'ll learn how \\nto design effective data structures for analysis and reporting.  \\n1. Introduction to Dimensional Modeling  \\nDimensional modeling is a design technique specifically tailored for data warehouses. Its \\nprimary goal is to present data in a standard, intuitive framework that allows for high -\\nperformance access. Unlike normalized data models used in transactional system s, dimensional \\nmodels are optimized for data retrieval and analysis.  \\nThe core principle of dimensional modeling is to structure data around business processes and \\ntheir measurements. This approach results in a model that\\'s both easy for business users to \\nunderstand and efficient for query performance.  \\n2. Facts: The Measure of Business Processes  \\nFacts are the quantitative or measurable data in a business process. They represent what we\\'re \\nanalyzing or measuring.  \\nKey Characteristics of Facts:  \\n• Numeric values that can be aggregated (summed, averaged, etc.)  • Represent business measurements or metrics  \\n• Often additive across multiple dimensions  \\nExamples of Facts:  \\n• Sales amount  \\n• Quantity sold  \\n• Profit  \\n• Number of website visits  \\n• Customer service call duration  \\nFacts are typically stored in fact tables, which form the center of our dimensional model.  \\n3. Dimensions: The Context of Business Processes  \\nDimensions provide the context to facts. They are the \"who, what, where, when, why, and how\" \\nof a business process.  \\nKey Characteristics of Dimensions:  \\n• Descriptive attributes that allow for filtering and grouping  \\n• Provide the context for analyzing facts  \\n• Often hierarchical in nature  \\nExamples of Dimensions:  \\n• Date (with hierarchies like Year > Quarter > Month > Day)  \\n• Product (with hierarchies like Category > Subcategory > Product)  \\n• Customer (with attributes like Name, Age, Location)  \\n• Store Location (with hierarchies like Country > State > City)  \\nDimensions are stored in dimension tables, which surround and connect to the fact table.  \\n4. Star Schema: The Fundamental Dimensional Model  \\nThe Star Schema is the most basic and widely used dimensional model.  \\nStructure:  \\n• A central fact table connected directly to multiple dimension tables  \\n• Resembles a star shape, hence the name  \\nCharacteristics:  \\n• Simple and intuitive design  \\n• Faster query performance due to fewer joins  • Dimension tables are denormalized (redundant data allowed)  \\nExample of a Star Schema for a Sales data warehouse: [Insert visual representation of a star \\nschema with a central \"Sales Fact\" table connected to \"Date\", \"Product\", \"Customer\", and \\n\"Store\" dimension tables]  \\n5. Snowflake Schema: A Normalized Variation  \\nThe Snowflake Schema is a variation of the star schema where dimension tables are normalized \\ninto multiple related tables.  \\nStructure:  \\n• Similar to  star schema, but dimension tables are split into multiple tables  \\n• Resembles a snowflake shape  \\nCharacteristics:  \\n• Reduces data redundancy through normalization  \\n• More complex queries due to additional joins  \\n• Can be more difficult to understand and maintain  \\nExample of a Snowflake Schema for the same Sales data warehouse: [Insert visual representation \\nof a snowflake schema, expanding on the star schema by normalizing dimensions like \"Product\" \\ninto separate \"Category\" and \"Subcategory\" tables]  \\n6. Choosing Between Star and Snowflake Schemas  \\nThe choice between star and snowflake schemas depends on various factors:  \\nStar Schema Benefits:  \\n• Simpler queries and faster performance  \\n• Easier for business users to understand  \\n• Better suited for OLAP cubes  \\nSnowflake Schema Benefits:  \\n• Saves storage space through normalization  \\n• Easier to maintain dimension hierarchies  \\n• Better data integrity due to normalization  \\nIn practice, many data warehouses use a hybrid approach, snowflaking only the dimensions \\nwhere it provides significant benefits.  \\nSummary:  Dimensional modeling is a crucial skill for effective data warehouse design. By understanding \\nfacts, dimensions, and schema types, you can create data structures that balance performance, \\nusability, and maintainability. The choice between star and snowflak e schemas  ensures that your \\ndata warehouse can provide accurate, historical analysis to support business decision -making.  \\nTOPIC 5 \\n \\nConceptualizing the Data pipeline process, with a study case of a “something” industry. \\nFrom Data Ingestion, To Pass Data Quality check, using ETL tools. No deep dive yet, just a \\ndemo of how it works, practices.  \\n \\nWill deep dive in the next course which is a comprehensive study case and implementation \\nand understand the tools.  '"
